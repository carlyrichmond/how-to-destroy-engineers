# How to Destroy _Engineers_

This repo contains slides and useful resources for learning best practices for building a strong DevOps and collaborative culture in teams of different disciplines. As a current Principal Developer Advocate and Manager, and prior Software Engineer, Team Lead and Manager, I can leverage my own career experiences to share team antipatterns.

The common antipatterns to look out for are:

1. Bombarding teams with alerts from noisy applications and microservices. These alerts may be the result of false positives, false negatives or symptoms not synonymous with a particular failure. Furthermore, they may be sent to software tools such as email or other communication tools that make it difficult to search for patterns, leading to alert fatigue and frustration. 
2. Have team members always on call, or subjected to interruptions even when they are not on call.
3. Comparing performance metrics across teams, instead of as a mechanism to track the improvement of a given team. 
4. Encourage jerkish code review culture, and encourage non-constructive feedback that doesn't help teams learn or improve their code.
5. Overload them with many different tools that make for regular context switching. These tools should also be regularly swapped for alternatives, meaning time is taken to learn, install and configure tools, as well as migrate data that doesn't conform to current standards.
6. Build flaky tests, or non-deterministic tests, that randomly fail and lead to reruns of CI pipelines and builds.
7. Encourage constant working on tickets, specifically small or poorly defined items, and leave no space for learning or trying out new technologies in techniques to improve ways of working and eliminate toil.
8. Stop them attend conferences and meetups to learn and contribute ideas.

These themes are covered in several of my talks, including:
